CERBERUS NETWORK DEFENDER
Advanced Deception Technology & Moving Target Defense System
Version
Python
License

CERBERUS is a military-grade network defense system that combines advanced deception technology, moving target defense, and autonomous response capabilities to detect, divert, and analyze threats in real-time.

üõ°Ô∏è Core Capabilities
Advanced Honeypot Arrays: Deploy convincing decoys that trap and analyze attacker techniques
Moving Target Defense: Dynamically shift network topology to evade reconnaissance and targeting
Multi-Spectrum Monitoring: Comprehensive visibility across all network communication channels
Autonomous Response: Automatically contain and mitigate detected threats
Attacker Attribution: Profile and identify threat actors based on behavior patterns
üöÄ Key Features
Realistic decoy deployment across multiple network segments
Dynamic IP, port, and service rotation to confuse attackers
Behavioral analysis of attacker interactions with decoys
Real-time threat intelligence generation from attack patterns
Sophisticated attacker profiling with attribution capabilities
Configurable deception complexity and response automation
üìã Requirements
Python 3.8+
Linux/Unix operating system (preferred)
Administrator/root privileges for network configuration
Dedicated network interface(s) for monitoring
Minimum 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores
100GB+ storage for interaction logs and analysis data
‚öôÔ∏è Installation
bash

Hide
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cerberus-defender.git
cd cerberus-defender

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure the system
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your network settings

# Run initial network scan
python cerberus.py --scan-only

# Deploy the full defensive system
python cerberus.py --deploy
üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Deploying Decoy Infrastructure
python

Hide
from cerberus import CerberusDefender

# Initialize Cerberus in your target network zone
defender = CerberusDefender("production_network")

# Deploy decoy infrastructure across all subnets
decoy_results = defender.deploy_decoy_infrastructure()
print(f"Deployed {decoy_results['total_decoys_deployed']} decoys across {decoy_results['subnets_covered']} subnets")

# Or deploy in a specific subnet
subnet_decoys = defender.deploy_decoy_infrastructure(target_subnet="10.0.1.0/24")
print(f"Deployed {subnet_decoys['total_decoys_deployed']} decoys in target subnet")
Implementing Moving Target Defense
python

Hide
# Activate Moving Target Defense
mtd_results = defender.implement_moving_target_defense()
print(f"MTD Status: {mtd_results['status']}")
print(f"Next topology shift scheduled for: {mtd_results['next_shift']}")

# Get current defense status
status = defender.get_status_report()
print(f"Active decoys: {status['decoys']['active_count']}")
print(f"Decoy interactions: {status['decoys']['interactions']}")
print(f"Topology shifts: {status['moving_target_defense']['topology_shifts']}")
Generating Threat Reports
python

Hide
# Generate comprehensive threat report
threat_report = defender.generate_threat_report()
print(f"Total attackers tracked: {threat_report['total_attackers']}")
print(f"High-threat attackers: {threat_report['high_threat_count']}")

# View top attack patterns
for pattern in threat_report['attack_patterns']:
    print(f"Pattern: {pattern['sequence']}")
    print(f"Description: {pattern['description']}")
    print(f"Frequency: {pattern['frequency']}")
üîê Security Considerations
Ensure you have proper authorization to deploy deception technology in your network
Consider the potential impact of Moving Target Defense on legitimate services
Implement proper access controls to the Cerberus management interface
Review and approve autonomous response actions based on your risk tolerance
Regularly back up configuration and threat intelligence data
üìä Dashboard
CERBERUS includes a web-based dashboard for monitoring and control:

Real-time visualization of decoy interactions
Attacker activity timeline and geographic mapping
Threat actor profiles and attribution confidence
Moving Target Defense configuration and scheduling
Alert management and response automation controls
Access the dashboard at https://<cerberus-host>:8443/dashboard after deployment.

üîÑ Integration Options
CERBERUS can integrate with:

SIEM systems via syslog and REST API
Threat intelligence platforms via STIX/TAXII
Network security controls (firewalls, IPS) for automated blocking
Authentication systems for credential monitoring
Existing honeypot deployments
