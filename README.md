# CERBERUS NETWORK DEFENDER - Advanced Deception Technology & Moving Target Defense System

A military-grade network defense system that combines advanced deception technology, moving target defense, and autonomous response capabilities to detect, divert, and analyze threats in real-time.

---

## 🛡️ Core Capabilities

### 🎭 Advanced Honeypot Arrays
- Deploy convincing decoys that trap and analyze attacker techniques.

### 🌀 Moving Target Defense
- Dynamically shift network topology to evade reconnaissance and targeting.

### 📡 Multi-Spectrum Monitoring
- Comprehensive visibility across all network communication channels.

### 🤖 Autonomous Response
- Automatically contain and mitigate detected threats.

### 🔍 Attacker Attribution
- Profile and identify threat actors based on behavior patterns.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Realistic decoy deployment across multiple network segments.
- Dynamic IP, port, and service rotation to confuse attackers.
- Behavioral analysis of attacker interactions with decoys.
- Real-time threat intelligence generation from attack patterns.
- Sophisticated attacker profiling with attribution capabilities.
- Configurable deception complexity and response automation.

---

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Linux/Unix operating system (preferred)
- Administrator/root privileges for network configuration
- Dedicated network interface(s) for monitoring
- Minimum 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores
- 100GB+ storage for interaction logs and analysis data

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cerberus-defender.git
cd cerberus-defender
```

### Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure the system:
```bash
cp config.example.json config.json

```

### Run initial network scan:
```bash
python cerberus.py --scan-only
```

### Deploy the full defensive system:
```bash
python cerberus.py --deploy
```

---

## 🔧 Usage

### Deploying Decoy Infrastructure

```python
from cerberus import CerberusDefender

defender = CerberusDefender("production_network")
decoy_results = defender.deploy_decoy_infrastructure()
print(f"Deployed {decoy_results['total_decoys_deployed']} decoys across {decoy_results['subnets_covered']} subnets")
```

### Implementing Moving Target Defense

```python
mtd_results = defender.implement_moving_target_defense()
print(f"MTD Status: {mtd_results['status']}")
print(f"Next topology shift scheduled for: {mtd_results['next_shift']}")
```

### Generating Threat Reports

```python
threat_report = defender.generate_threat_report()
print(f"Total attackers tracked: {threat_report['total_attackers']}")
print(f"High-threat attackers: {threat_report['high_threat_count']}")
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Ensure you have proper authorization to deploy deception technology in your network.
- Consider the potential impact of Moving Target Defense on legitimate services.
- Implement proper access controls to the Cerberus management interface.
- Review and approve autonomous response actions based on your risk tolerance.
- Regularly back up configuration and threat intelligence data.

---

## 📊 Dashboard

CERBERUS includes a web-based dashboard for monitoring and control:
- Real-time visualization of decoy interactions
- Attacker activity timeline and geographic mapping
- Threat actor profiles and attribution confidence
- Moving Target Defense configuration and scheduling
- Alert management and response automation controls

Access the dashboard at `https://<your-ip>:8443/dashboard` after deployment.
